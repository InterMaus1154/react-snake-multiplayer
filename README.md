**Part of the preparation for the WorldSkills 2024 Lyon competition.**\
**This is a classic snake game - but with two players.**\
**First player is controlled by arrow keys, the second player is controlled by WASD**\
**Point is gained by eating the food, the game is over if one of the snakes collides with itself or with the other**\
**Colours can be customised to better suit user experience**\

**The game can be accessed here: https://react-snake-multiplayer.onrender.com/ **\

**Made with: React + TypeScript**
